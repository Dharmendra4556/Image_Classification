Image Classification Project( Cat and Dog Recognition )
**This project entails the development of an advanced image classification system specifically designed for distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. Leveraging state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the project aims to achieve high accuracy and robust performance in recognizing and categorizing these two distinct classes of animals.**
